### Course Description

This course aims at providing students modeling skills, optimization algorithms, and its applications in big data analysis, with a special emphasis on deep understanding on various optimization algorithms. Mathematics is heavily involved in this course. (3 credits)



### Course Objectives

After this course, students should be able to

+ formulate a scientiﬁc problem into an optimization problem that can be solved;
+ understand the mathematical background for diﬀerent optimization methods (convergence analysis and the motivation of the algorithms);
+ numerically implement the optimization algorithms;
+ solve the scientiﬁc problem using optimization methods.



### Recommended Background

In this course, linear algebra, matrix computation, and analysis will be heavily involved. 

You will be using Matlab or Python for programming. 



### Zoom and Online Resources

The lecture meetings will be in Zoom. There are workshops on online resources from MSU IT  https://iteach.msu.edu/iteachmsu/groups/iteachmsu/stories/1389

+ Student Semester Kick-oﬀ: January 11th Session 1: 10 AM to 11:15 AM; Session 2: 2 PM to 3:15 PM

## Course Policies

### Course Announcements

+ Announcements will be emailed to the course mailing list (D2L). If you do not receive the welcome message before the first class, please let me know.

### Policy for Missing a Required Assignment
+ Excused absences will be given only with documentation and only for valid medical reasons, university business, or appearances in court.
+ Any unexcused work will be counted as a 0, including the ﬁnal exam if there is one.
+ Any student with a valid reason to be excused from a work must contact the instructor prior to the work or due date and present documentation in the next class session attended.

### Grading Complaints

+ If you notice a mistake, you have to bring it to my attention within one week after the day your work was returned.
+ Grading complaints not initiated within this period of time will not be considered.

### Regrading

+ If you believe a question has been graded incorrectly, please submit an explanation on a separate sheet of paper, attach it to the work in question, and submit it to me within one week after the day your work was returned.

### Academic Honesty

+ Cheating of any kind is wrong.
+ Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to: copying homework solutions, cheating on any of the exams (including using material not allowed to be used).
+ The students are allowed to discuss homework problems with each other, but they must write their solutions on their own.
+ For more detailed information, visit the Ombud’s website for academic integrity: https://ombud.msu.edu/resources-self-help/academic-integrity.

### Students with Disabilities

If you have a disability that requires some kind of accommodation, you should contact the Resource Center for Persons with Disabilities (RCPD) as soon as possible.

+ To make an appointment with a specialist, contact: (517) 353-9642 or TeleTYprewriter (TTY): (517) 355-1293
+  Web site for RCPD: http://MYProﬁle.rcpd.msu.edu 

### Changes in the Syllabus
There may be changes to the syllabus during the semester. These changes will be mentioned in class or by email, but it is ultimately the responsibility of the student to remain aware of any changes.
